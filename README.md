### Weather and Study Companion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Project Overview

This project aims to incorporate two popular application functions into one, to create an online "widget-like"companion for study or work purposes. The weather function displays information on current weather conditions based on the user's location. Weather-related ambient sounds can also be toggled. The card-based layout is designed for the purpose of increasing user interactivity by allowing users to flip to the other side for additional features. The alternative side is a pomodoro-style timer, created for study and work purposes. The timer can be manipulated with the play, pause and reset buttons.
